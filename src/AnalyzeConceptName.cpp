TODO:
  Analyze the concept names of the given code.
  If there exists concept names with prefix "Aerith_Concept",
  then return the biggest following ID (`id`) after this prefix.
  This is important for the name initialization of our inserted concepts.
  e.g., if `id` is 78, then `Add1stConcept` will starts with the first concept with id 79.
  For each concept inserted, the id of our concept will be increased by 1.
